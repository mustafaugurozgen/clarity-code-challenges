# Clarity Code Challenges


Clarity is a smart contract language that is used in Stacks Blockchain. 

This repo includes the code challenges of Hiro's [Master of Clarity](https://hirosystems.mmm.page/masterofclarity) competition. 
It is a 10 day competition with 10 challenges. Each challenge has a few quiz questions and coding tasks. I have only shared my code solutions.
